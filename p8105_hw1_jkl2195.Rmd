# Problem 1
```{r}
# Load libraries tidyverse(contains ggplot) and moderndive(contains dataset early_january_weather)
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)


# Load the early_january_weather dataset
data(early_january_weather)
summary(early_january_weather)

```

The names of the variables are `r names(early_january_weather)`. There are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns in total. The mean value for temp variable is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`.

```{r}
# Renders the scatter plot which temp is the x-axis and time_hour is the y axis. Points are colored using humid variable

time_hour_vs_temp_plot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()

# Saves the plot as a png file in the current repo
ggsave("Temp vs Time Hour.png", time_hour_vs_temp_plot)
```
